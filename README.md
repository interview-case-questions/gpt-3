# gpt-3

# Case Study

Below I listed out 3 github examples that uses gpt3 and dash.


(1) https://github.com/plotly/dash-sample-apps/tree/main/apps/dash-chatbot

(2) https://github.com/plotly/dash-sample-apps/tree/main/apps/dash-gpt3-bars

(3) https://github.com/plotly/dash-sample-apps/tree/main/apps/dash-gpt3-lines


Your goal is to pick 1 of the 3 examples and recreate within your own Github repository while making modifications of your choosing. Have fun with it and make it your own.

You will present your solution to a panel, assume you will have roughly 15 minutes to demo and another 15 for questions.

You are free to use any tools or technology, but be prepared to discuss the reasoning for your choices.

High level potential steps to take:

(1) Clone 1 of the 3 repositories to your personal Github account

(2) Get the example working end-to-end within your repository

(3) Make custom modifications of your chosing

(4) Push the final changes into your personal Github repository
